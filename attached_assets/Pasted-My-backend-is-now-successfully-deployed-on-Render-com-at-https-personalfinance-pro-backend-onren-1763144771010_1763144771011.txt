My backend is now successfully deployed on Render.com at:
https://personalfinance-pro-backend.onrender.com

Now I need to prepare my PersonalFinance Pro app to be built as an Android APK using Capacitor. The mobile app needs to connect to this deployed backend.

What I need you to do:

1. **Update CORS Configuration**
   - Open server/index.ts
   - Update the CORS settings to allow requests from:
     - capacitor://localhost (Android app scheme)
     - https://localhost (Android app HTTPS)
     - Any other origins needed for Capacitor apps
   - Keep existing development origins (http://localhost:5000, etc.)

2. **Configure Capacitor for Production**
   - Open capacitor.config.ts
   - Update the server URL to point to: https://personalfinance-pro-backend.onrender.com
   - Ensure webDir is correctly set to 'dist/public'
   - Keep androidScheme as 'https'

3. **Create Mobile Build Script**
   - Add a new script to package.json called "build:mobile"
   - This script should:
     - Set VITE_API_URL=https://personalfinance-pro-backend.onrender.com
     - Run vite build to create production frontend
   - Example: "build:mobile": "VITE_API_URL=https://personalfinance-pro-backend.onrender.com vite build"

4. **Add Android Platform**
   - Check if android/ folder already exists
   - If not, run: npx cap add android
   - If it exists, verify it's configured correctly

5. **Configure Android Permissions**
   - Ensure android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml exists and has:
     - INTERNET permission
     - ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permission
   - These are required for the app to connect to the backend

6. **Create APK Build Documentation**
   - Create a file called APK_BUILD_GUIDE.md
   - Include step-by-step instructions for:
     a. Running npm run build:mobile to build the frontend
     b. Running npx cap sync android to copy files to Android project
     c. Running npx cap open android to open in Android Studio
     d. Building the APK in Android Studio (Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s))
     e. Finding the APK file at: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

7. **Test the Setup**
   - Run npm run build:mobile to verify the build works
   - Check that dist/public folder is created with the frontend files
   - Verify the built files reference the Render.com backend URL

Important Notes:
- The mobile app must use the deployed backend URL, not localhost
- CORS must be configured to accept Capacitor app origins
- The build process should work without errors
- Don't modify package.json dependencies, just add the build script

After completing these tasks, I should be able to:
1. Build the production frontend with npm run build:mobile
2. Sync with Capacitor using npx cap sync android
3. Open in Android Studio with npx cap open android
4. Generate the APK file

Please complete all these tasks and let me know when done.
