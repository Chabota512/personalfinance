Planned deployment folder structure (4 seconds)
Perfect! I'll create a deployment/ folder with all the necessary files copied into it, without affecting your running app. This will give you a clean, self-contained package ready to push to GitHub and deploy on Render.

Here's my approach:

What I'll copy to the deployment folder:

Source code: client/, server/, shared/ folders
Configuration files: package.json, vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, tsconfig.json, drizzle.config.ts, postcss.config.js, components.json
Deployment files: render.yaml, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
Database: migrations/ folder
Assets: attached_assets/ folder (if you have custom images)
What I'll create fresh:

.gitignore - To exclude node_modules, build outputs, and dev files
.env.example - Template for environment variables
deployment/README.md - Quick deployment instructions
What I'll exclude (not needed for deployment):

node_modules/, dist/, data/, .replit, test files, backup files, local development artifacts
This will give you a clean folder you can zip up or push to GitHub for Render deployment.
