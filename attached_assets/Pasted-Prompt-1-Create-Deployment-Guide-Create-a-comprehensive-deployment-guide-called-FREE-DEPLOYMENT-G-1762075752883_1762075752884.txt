Prompt 1: Create Deployment Guide
Create a comprehensive deployment guide called "FREE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md" in the PersonalFinance folder with these sections:
1. NEON DATABASE SETUP
- Step-by-step instructions to create a free Neon account at neon.tech
- How to create a new project and database
- Where to find the connection string
- How to copy the connection string (should look like: postgresql://user:password@ep-xxx.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require)
- Explain they need to save this for later
2. RENDER BACKEND DEPLOYMENT
- Step-by-step to create free Render account at render.com
- How to create a new "Web Service" 
- How to connect to GitHub (they'll need to push their PersonalFinance project to GitHub first)
- Build settings to use:
  * Name: personalfinance-backend
  * Environment: Node
  * Build Command: npm install && npm run build
  * Start Command: npm start
- Environment variables to add:
  * DATABASE_URL = (paste Neon connection string here)
  * NODE_ENV = production
  * Any other env vars from their .env file if they have one
- Explain that Render will give them a URL like: https://personalfinance-backend.onrender.com
3. PUSH TO GITHUB INSTRUCTIONS
- How to create a new GitHub repository
- Git commands to push PersonalFinance folder:
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git remote add origin <their-repo-url>
  git push -u origin main
Include troubleshooting tips for common issues.

Prompt 2: Update Capacitor Config
Add a section to FREE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md explaining how to update the mobile app to use the deployed backend:
CONNECTING ANDROID APP TO DEPLOYED BACKEND:
1. Open capacitor.config.ts in the PersonalFinance folder
2. Remove or comment out any existing server configuration
3. The app will now use relative URLs which work with the deployed backend
4. BUT WAIT - mobile apps need absolute URLs! So we need to configure the API base URL
Explain they have two options:
OPTION A: Use environment variable in the app
- Update client code to use the Render URL
- Create a .env file with VITE_API_URL=https://their-render-url.onrender.com
OPTION B: Proxy through Capacitor (simpler)
- Keep the app code as-is
- The app makes requests to /api/...
- These need to go to the Render server instead
Actually, the simplest solution: Update the apiRequest function in client/src/lib/queryClient.ts to use the full Render URL when in production/mobile context.
Show the code change needed.

Prompt 3: Capacitor Update Guide
Create a new file "CAPACITOR_UPDATE_GUIDE.md" in the PersonalFinance folder with:
HOW TO UPDATE CAPACITOR TO LATEST VERSION:
1. Check current version:
   npm list @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/android
2. Update all Capacitor packages:
   npm install @capacitor/core@latest @capacitor/cli@latest @capacitor/android@latest
3. Sync changes to Android project:
   npx cap sync android
4. Open in Android Studio:
   npx cap open android
5. Let Gradle sync complete
6. Test the app
IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Always update all Capacitor packages together (core, cli, android)
- After updating, always run npx cap sync
- Check the changelog at https://capacitorjs.com for breaking changes
- If you get errors, try: 
  * Clean project in Android Studio (Build → Clean Project)
  * Invalidate caches (File → Invalidate Caches → Restart)
Include version compatibility notes.

Prompt 4: Add Troubleshooting Section
Add a detailed troubleshooting section to FREE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md:
COMMON DEPLOYMENT ISSUES:
1. "Application error" on Render
   - Check Render logs
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
   - Make sure build command succeeded
2. "Database connection failed"
   - Verify Neon connection string is correct
   - Check if Neon database is active (free tier may pause)
   - Ensure SSL mode is in connection string
3. "CORS errors" from mobile app
   - Need to add CORS middleware in Express server
   - Show code to add to server/index.ts
4. "Cold start delays" (Render free tier)
   - Free tier sleeps after 15 min inactivity
   - First request may take 30-60 seconds
   - This is normal for free tier
5. Mobile app shows "Network error"
   - Verify the Render URL is correct in app code
   - Check if Render app is awake
   - Test the API in browser first
Include code examples for fixes.
