I need to convert my PersonalFinance Pro full-stack web app into an Android APK using Capacitor. The backend will be deployed on Render.com, and the mobile app will connect to that deployed backend.

Current State:

Full-stack app with React frontend and Express backend
Backend uses Neon Postgres database (already cloud-based with DATABASE_URL)
Frontend currently makes API calls to relative paths (works in dev because Vite proxies to backend)
There are 4 LSP diagnostics that need fixing (1 in server/index.ts, 3 in server/storage.ts)
Capacitor packages are already installed (@capacitor/android, @capacitor/cli, @capacitor/core)
Goal:
Prepare the entire app for:

Backend deployment to Render.com
Building an Android APK with Capacitor that connects to the deployed backend
What I need you to do:

Phase 1: Fix Code Issues

Check and fix all 4 LSP diagnostics in server/index.ts and server/storage.ts
Phase 2: Backend Deployment Prep
2. Create a .env.example file documenting all required environment variables for Render.com

Update frontend API configuration to use VITE_API_URL environment variable instead of relative paths
Create a lib/api-config.ts or update the existing queryClient to dynamically use the API URL based on environment
Ensure backend CORS settings allow requests from mobile app (configure proper origins)
Create deployment documentation or render.yaml file with necessary settings for Render.com
Phase 3: Capacitor Configuration
7. Initialize Capacitor with npx cap init (app name: "PersonalFinance Pro", package ID: "com.personalfinance.pro")

Create/update capacitor.config.ts with proper configuration
Configure Android permissions needed (internet, network state, etc.)
Add Android platform with npx cap add android if not already added
Update build scripts if needed for production Capacitor builds
Phase 4: Environment Setup
12. Create a .env.production template showing how to set VITE_API_URL for production builds

Document the complete deployment and build process in a DEPLOYMENT.md file
Important Notes:

The app uses session-based auth with express-session
Backend already handles DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET environment variables
Don't break the existing development workflow (keep npm run dev working)
Make sure the production build points to the Render.com URL (we'll set this later)
Please create a task list and complete all these steps. After you're done, provide me with:

The Render.com environment variables I need to set
